# TeamworkWithMiyoshi

Goal Sheet 00

This goal sheet is for use during the first two weeks of the year/semester.

## Background

Teamwork is an important aspect of life.  We need to work in teams whether we are in school or on the job.  It is also one of the core values that I teach in my classroom.  So I decided to put my money where my mouth is and actually do a lot of team building rather than just let it happen.

The tasks below are designed to get people to know each other and help them decide who they want to be teammates with.  Those students who have worked in teams before know that there are times when one student does the majority of the work and others skate by.  The goal of these tasks is to figure out how to select teammates who will not do this.  Besides, not every assignment in class will be done with teams.  Many things will be done individually.  After all, you need to gain knowledge and develop skills to become adept at anything.

These six tasks are to be done the first two weeks of class.  You will use the first four as the basis for choosing your team.  You will want to prove that you are a good team member and/or a good team leader.  The next to last item is forming teams.  The last item is your first team assignment.

Task | Description
---- | -----------
Create a resume. | Tell why you would be a good team member in a design team.  Give concrete reasons.  Remember that a resume is all about you, so you never need to use the words, I, me, my, etc.  Use action words to describe the things you have done.  You may never have had a job before, so concentrate on skills that you have or volunteer activities you have done or clubs, teams, groups that you have been a part of.
Introduce another student. | Take the time to find out why a fellow student would be a good member of a design team.  Then, introduce the student giving three concrete reasons you would choose that person to be on a design team with you.  (Do this two or three times in a class period.)
Work Together	| Work together as a team to do a specific task as assigned by your instructor (i.e. Jigsaw puzzle).
Work Together	| Work together as a team to do a specific task as assigned by your instructor (i.e. Lego creation).
Choose your team. | When your team is formed, you will write down the names of the leaders and team members.  This single sheet of paper will be your goal sheet assignment.<ol type="A"><li>Programming.  Pair up first.  Decide who you would like to work with each week to write some of your programs.  Then, advanced students will choose two sets of pairs to create teams of four intro student with one advanced student leader.  Leaders will get random numbers assigned.  Leaders will choose one pair in order going in increasing numeric order, then, the second choice will be in order going in decreasing numeric order.</li><li>Engineering.  Group leaders will get to choose their teams of three.  Leaders will get random numbers assigned.  Leaders will choose one person in order going in increasing numeric order, then, the second choice will be in order going in decreasing numeric order.</li></ol>
Work Together | Perform the first task as a team.  <ol type="A"><li>Programming.  Write the steps to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  If somebody in the group is allergic to any of the ingredients, you may choose to write the instructions of a different sandwich or a different food.</li><li>Engineering.  A ½” peg will not fit into a ½” hole.  As a group, figure out the diameter your peg needs to be to fit into the ½” hole so that when pressed together, the peg will not some out by merely pressing by hand.  You will be 3D printing your solution.  The thing is that your group may only print one peg.  The group that gives the correct drawing of the correct size peg will receive bonus points for the activity.</li></ol>
